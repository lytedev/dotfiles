fsw - run a command when a file is modified - v$_VERSION

Usage:
${I}fsw <command> [filter] [dirs...]

${I}command - the specified bash command to eval
${I}filter  - an optional filename filter
${I}dirs    - the directories to watch (defaults to current directory)

Advanced:
${I}Command Variables:
${I}${I}Your commands have runtime access to some variables associated with the
${I}${I}${I}inotifywait event enabling further extensibility:
${I}${I}+ FSW_FILENAME    - the name of the file
${I}${I}+ FSW_DIR         - the directory containing the file
${I}${I}+ FSW_PATH        - the full relative path of the file
${I}${I}+ FSW_FILE_EVENTS - a comma-separated list of the inotify events
${I}Environment:
${I}${I}Some customization options exist using environment variables
${I}${I}${I}due to their uncommon usage.
${I}${I}+ FSW_EVENTS - the list of events to have inotifywait observe

References:
${I}+ Filter works with grep -P
${I}+ See inotifywait(1) for FSW_EVENTS options.

Examples:
${I}fsw 'make' '\.c$'
${I}fsw 'bash \$filename' '\.bash$'
${I}fsw 'mix test --failed' '.exs?$' lib test
${I}FSW_EVENTS=open,access fsw 'espeak "Intruder Alert!"' \\
${I}${I}${I}'.*' /etc/secrets \$HOME/.secrets
