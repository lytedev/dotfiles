# lytedev's dotfiles

My various configuration files. I can't recommend using them directly, just
take what you like.

# Basic Setup

    curl -Ss https://lyte.dev/df.sh | sh

## I don't like `curl ... | sh`

Clone the repo:

    git clone https://git.lyte.dev/lytedev/dotfiles.git "$HOME/.config/lytedev-dotfiles"

Inspect and run the common (no macOS- or Linux-specific configuration) setup
`fish` script:

    $EDITOR "$HOME/.config/lytedev-dotfiles/common/bin/dotfiles-setup"
    "$HOME/.config/lytedev-dotfiles/common/bin/dotfiles-setup"

## Post-Setup

You will want to symlink relevant environment layers into the `$ENV_PATH` in
order to have your OS-specific applications be configured and common
applications configured for the host OS.

There's a handy `fzf`-based script that makes this super easy (note that you
can select multiple environments with TAB):

    dotfiles-link-environments

You can also list the possible environments:

    cat $DOTFILES_PATH/common/envs

And then link them yourself (note that environments must be in $ENV_PATH and
cannot be nested, so replacing slashes with dashes is a nice way to show what's
going on):

    ln -s (pwd)/os/linux $ENV_PATH/os-linux
    ln -s (pwd)/os/linux/arch $ENV_PATH/os-linux-arch
    ln -s (pwd)/host/laptop $ENV_PATH/host-laptop
    ln -s (pwd)/host/laptop/third $ENV_PATH/os-laptop-third
    # etc...

And run setup again once you've finished linking all related environments:

    dotfiles-setup
