# Note

This repository is no longer maintained. I have moved all my configuration to
a Nix flake here: https://git.lyte.dev/lytedev/nix

I leave this repository up both for my own reference and for others.

# lytedev's dotfiles

My various configuration files. I can't recommend using them directly, just
take what you like.
