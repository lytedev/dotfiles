# Setup

```
curl -s -L https://git.lyte.dev/lytedev/dotfiles/raw/branch/master/bin/init-dotfiles | sh
```

# To Do

+ **Learn to use `journalctl`**
+ Fix sway workspaces on desktop
+ Neovim LSP
+ Move to NixOS (WIP) or Guix? Declarative is the future!
+ Better/more secure remote management configuration in dotfiles? [1][1]
+ Setup network file share?
+ Add vim in the terminal as the handler for many MIME types (xdg-open and such)
	for the rare time I'm in a file manager or for opening easily from
	the browser.
+ Unify all the common variables... somehow? (and use templates and `envsubst`?)
+ [Vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux)?
+ Investigate systemd services that may help with various tasks (homed, etc.)
