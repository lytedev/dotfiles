# Basic Usage

# To Do

- Wifi + Home DNS
- Rotate/switch gpg keys and password-store, setup properly on phone

  - Maybe something age/sops-based?

- Layered gitconfig?
- Get out of Google!
  - `calcurse` for Calendar management?
  - `aerc` or `neomutt` for email?
  - My home-grown backup network for Drive?
  - Photos?
- Hibernation and proper power management for laptop?
- **Learn to use `journalctl`**
- Fix sway workspaces on desktop?
- Neovim LSP
- Move to NixOS (WIP) or Guix? Declarative is the future!
- Better/more secure remote management configuration in dotfiles? [1][1]
- Setup network file share?
- Home VPN
- Add vim in the terminal as the handler for many MIME types (xdg-open and such)
  for the rare time I'm in a file manager or for opening easily from
  the browser.
  - This goes for navigating "into" a file in `nnn`
- Unify all the common variables... somehow? (and use templates and `envsubst`?)
- [Vimux](https://github.com/benmills/vimux)?
- Investigate systemd services that may help with various tasks (homed, etc.)
- Be more macOS friendly, since work may require that
