# lytedev's dotfiles

My various configuration files. I can't recommend using them directly, just
take what you like.

# Basic Setup

```bash
curl -LO lyte.dev/df.sh && sh -i df.sh
```

## Manual Setup

```bash
git clone https://git.lyte.dev/lytedev/dotfiles.git "$HOME/.config/lytedev-dotfiles"
"$HOME/.config/lytedev-dotfiles/common/bin/dotfiles-setup"
```

## Provisioned Setup

This method is incomplete and unstable. It takes a fresh box with a network
connection and fully sets it up the way I like.

```bash
curl -LO lyte.dev/dfi.sh && sh -i dfi.sh
```

# Repo Structure

My dotfiles are composed together by layering "environments" since I want my dotfiles to be flexible across servers, laptops, desktops, and even my phone (via Termux).

```
lytedev-dotfiles
|- common --- common to all hosts and operating systems
| |- bin ------- programs or scripts useful to all hosts/OSs
| |- data ------ shared storage for certain scripts
| '- {app...} -- configuration related to {app}
|- host ----- specific to specific hosts or types of hosts
| |- desktop --- for desktop-class machines
| |- headless -- for server-class machines with no display/GUI
| '- laptop ---- for portable, battery-having machines
'- os ------- specific to operating systems
	|- linux ----- you alread know <3
	|  |- desktop ------ for desktop-class machines
	|  |- headless ----- for server-class machines with no display/GUI
	|  |- bin ---------- programs/scripts useful to linux machines
	|  |- {distro...} -- configuration related to {distro}
	|  '- {app...} ----- linux-specific configuration related to {app}
	'- macos ----- for those stupid macbooks work tries to make you use
```

Any environment should be able to extend the configuration of any application
in some unique way. This isn't possible with all applications, of course, since
some programs do not make it easy (or possible) to include multiple
configuration files or to extend a single file by having it include others via
globs or some other mechanism.

One example of doing this well is with fish:

```fish
for s in $ENV_PATH/*/config.d.fish; source $s (dirname $s); end
```

This way, if any environment (a dir in $ENV_PATH) has a `config.f.fish` script
inside, it will be sourced by the main configuration file.

Likewise, some setup only happens in certain environments via the
`dotfiles-setup.d.fish` script.

One important note on environments is that even though they are laid out like
a tree (directories), you do NOT automatically get the parent-environment's
configuration, so if you are setting up a Arch Linux desktop machine, you
cannot only link the `os/linux/arch` and `host/desktop` environments but will
also need to include `os/linux` if you want the Linux-generic configuration.

# Post-Setup

You will want to symlink relevant environment layers into the `$ENV_PATH` in
order to have your OS-specific applications be configured and common
applications configured for the host OS.

There's a handy script that makes this super easy (note that you
can select multiple environments with TAB):

```bash
dotfiles-link-environments
```

You can also list the possible environments:

```bash
cat $DOTFILES_PATH/common/envs
```

And then link them yourself (note that environments must be in $ENV_PATH and
cannot be nested, so replacing slashes with dashes is a nice way to show what's
going on):

```
ln -s (pwd)/os/linux $ENV_PATH/os-linux
ln -s (pwd)/os/linux/arch $ENV_PATH/os-linux-arch
ln -s (pwd)/host/laptop $ENV_PATH/host-laptop
ln -s (pwd)/host/laptop/third $ENV_PATH/os-laptop-third
# etc...
```

And run setup again once you've finished linking all related environments:

```bash
dotfiles-setup
```

# Updating

Fork this repo, update your origin to point to your fork, and commit changes:

```bash
git remote origin set-url $YOUR_REPO
```

Then you can just pull your changes down from wherever.

## No I want your updates

You don't. I rip and tear my dotfiles all the time and will break your entire
machine. Remember about not using other people's dotfiles directly?

But if you must, you can add an upstream remote to point to my repo:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://git.lyte.dev/lytedev/dotfiles.git
```

Then you can fetch and merge in my changes whenever you want:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```

# Todo

They're littered throughout the repo in code comments. `rg -i todo`
