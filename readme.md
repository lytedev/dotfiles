# lytedev's dotfiles

My various configuration files. I can't recommend using them directly, just
take what you like.

**NOTE**: I'm in the process of migrating/copying some/all things from a wacky
combination of Arch Linux, other Linux distributions, and macOS, to a single
Nix flake for everything, including Arch Linux configs via Home Manager. Tread
lightly!
